DiUS Bowling
============
This is exercise implementation of a bowling scoring system.

Specification is accessible [here](https://gist.github.com/codingricky/2913943).

This concrete implementation should display several qualities of mature software development process including:

* Well thought top level application design.
* Easy to understand and maintainable code.
* Proper tests ensuring that the application is fully functional.
* Good work with VCS. In this case GIT.
* Easy-to-understand documentation in both JavaDoc and written forms.

More information about design decisions which were made during writing this app can be found in a `/ARCHITECTURE.md` file.

Prerequisites
-------------
To successfully run this application, the host system must have [Java 1.7](https://www.java.com/en/download/) or higher installed.
Whole app is created as a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) project and host system has to have Maven 3 installed. Information how to install those technologies can be found on their pages or google.

Running the application
-----------------------
1. Firstly clone this repository.
2. Change directory to it `cd dius_bowling`

All test are executed by command:

    mvn test


Main entry class and its behavior
----------------------------------
Main library class is BowlingGame, which has 2 important public methods

1. `#roll(int noOfPins)` which allows the user of the class to add new rolles.
2. `#score ()` which returns the current score of the game.

The instance of `BowlingGame` takes and processes rolls until the game is over. Then it is still possible to call `#roll()` method, but without any effect on `BowlingGame` instance.
